      <b>Painting</b> is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in
      elements such as drawing, composition, gesture (as in gestural painting),
      narration (as in narrative art), and abstraction (as in abstract art).[2]
      Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life and
      landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in
      Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as
      in Artivism).A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and
      Western art is dominated by religious art. Examples of this kind of
      painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to
      Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of
      Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).

    </div>
    <p style="margin: 15px; text-align: justify">
      <b>Our goal is to be on walls of each person's home.</b> a home, or
      domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for
      one or many humans, and sometimes various companion animals. It is a fully
      or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to
      it. Homes provide sheltered spaces, for instance rooms, where domestic
      activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and
      hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote
      working, studying and playing.
